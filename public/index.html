1.
Take a look at the Random component class. Random's job is to store a random color, and to use that color to update the screen's background.

First, let's store this random color as state.

Give Random a constructor() method. Give constructor() one parameter, named props.

Inside the body of constructor(), write the line super(props);.

Still inside the body of constructor(), on a new line, set this.state equal to this object:

{ color: [x, y, z] }
Instead of x, y, and z, use three numbers between 0 and 255.

2.
Good!

Change the three numbers inside of the color array to three different numbers. Click Save. The background color should change!

3.
It would be nice to know what color we're looking at!

In the render() method, inside of the <h1></h1>, add the text, Your color is ___.

Instead of ___, access this.state.color!

4.
That's not a very friendly way to display a color!

In Random, find the method named formatColor. This method transforms an rgb array into something a bit more readable.

Inside of the <h1></h1>, instead of simply using this.state.color, call the formatColor function and pass in this.state.color as an argument.

5.
That's a bit better!

A user should be able to click on a button to pick a new random color. In the code editor, you can see a Button.js file. That will be your button!

Select Button.js. Add the word export so that you are exporting the Button component class.

6.
Good! Now, if you import Button into Random.js, and you'll get the Button component class that you want.

Select Random.js. Near the top of the file, create a new line after import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';.

On this new line, use import the Button component class.

Button.js and Random.js share the same parent directory.

7.
Now you're ready to render a <Button /> instance!

Inside of Random's render method, after the <h1></h1>, add a <Button />.

Give your <Button /> this attribute:

light={this.isLight()}
8.
You can see your <Button /> instance in the browser. However, clicking it doesn't do anything!

You need to define an event handler that updates this.state.color to a new random color.

Give Random a new method named handleClick.

Inside of .handleClick()'s body, call this.setState(). As an argument, pass this.setState() an object with the following property:

color: this.chooseColor()
9.
You just created a new method, that you will eventually use as an event handler. Your new method uses this.

That means that you need to bind your new method.

Add a new line to your constructor() method. On this new line, bind handleClick().

10.
Great! this.handleClick() will update this.state.color to a new, random color.

Now that you've defined an event handler, you can pass it to another component as a prop. This is a pattern that you'll see much more of in the next course.

In Random's render method, give <Button /> an attribute with a name of onClick. Set onClick's value equal to the handleClick method.

11.
Only one more step!

Select Button.js. In the render function, give the <button></button> an onClick attribute. Set onClick's value equal to the passed-in prop.

12.
Try clicking the button a few times!

If you tried to make sense of the built-in parts of Random, you may have come up confused. This is because Random includes two special functions that we haven't discussed yet: componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

These functions are examples of a powerful React feature called lifecycle methods. You'll learn all about lifecycle methods in Introduction to React.js: Part II.

BONUS: Notice that the <h1></h1>'s text is white if the screen's background is a darker color, but the text is black is the screen's background is a lighter color. Similarly, the <button></button> changes colors based on whether the background is dark or light. Can you figure out how that works?
